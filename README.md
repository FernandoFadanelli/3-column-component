# Frontend Mentor - 3-column preview card component

The challenge was to build out this 3-column preview card component and get it looking as close to the design as possible. The users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for interactive elements

This challenge helped me better understand the flexbox layout system of CSS.

## Where to find everything

Your task is to build out the project to the designs inside the `/design` folder. You will find both a mobile and a desktop version of the design.

The designs are in JPG static format. Using JPGs will mean that you'll need to use your best judgment for styles such as `font-size`, `padding` and `margin`.

If you would like the design files (we provide Sketch & Figma versions) to inspect the design in more detail, you can [subscribe as a PRO member](https://www.frontendmentor.io/pro).

You will find all the required assets in the `/images` folder. The assets are already optimized.

There is also a `style-guide.md` file containing the information you'll need, such as color palette and fonts.
